## 🔧 Import Path Updates

### Fixed Import Issues
1. **Test Scripts**: Updated to import from current directory
2. **Training Scripts**: Updated relative paths to modeling folder
3. **Feature Engine**: Enhanced with advanced features integration

### Working Import Examples
```python
# From modeling folder
from feature_engine import FeatureEngine
from feature_engineering_advanced import AdvancedFeatureEngineer

# From training folder
sys.path.append(os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), '..', 'modeling'))
from feature_engineering_advanced import AdvancedFeatureEngineer
```

## 🚀 Production Readiness

### Enhanced FeatureEngine Usage
```python
# Initialize with advanced features (default behavior)
feature_engine = FeatureEngine(
    bts_airport_df=airport_lookup,
    bts_carrier_df=carrier_lookup,
    lookup_df=flight_lookup,
    use_advanced_features=True  # Default: True
)

# Build features - automatically includes 25 advanced features
features = feature_engine.build_features(
    carrier="AA",
    origin="LAX",
    dest="JFK",
    flight_date=date(2025, 7, 15),
    dep_hour=14
)
# Result: 61 features (36 base + 25 advanced)
```

### Backward Compatibility
```python
# Disable advanced features if needed
feature_engine = FeatureEngine(
    bts_airport_df=airport_lookup,
    bts_carrier_df=carrier_lookup,
    lookup_df=flight_lookup,
    use_advanced_features=False  # Fallback to original behavior
)
# Result: 36 features (original behavior)
```
